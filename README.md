# TO RUN ACCEPTANCE TESTS

option 1:  Run the acceptance test before running anything in the application. so, when you first download the project build and run the app. After that, don not make any changes in the app and close the app it self and then run all the acceptance test.

option 2: If you have checked the app then clear all the data from the app setting (Instruction: long click on app icon -> click app info -> go to storage -> clean data). After that run the app and do not make any changes to the app. Close the app and then run all acceptance tests.

# Branching Strategy

We are using the cactus model as our branching strategy. Each group memeber has their own branch to work within, which is based from the master (and ideally frequently rebased). Our changes are first merged into the testing branch, then once they are confirmed to be working, the testing branch is pushed to main. This is fine for now, since we have a very limited amount of features. As the code gets more complex, more branches will be made as needed to add some smaller features and changes. Those branches will likely be short lived.



# Personal Financial App Vision Statement

The Personal Financial App will be used to keep track of a user’s financial history, as well as plan for the future. The app will be a mobile app designed for devices running Android OS. The core functions of the app will allow users to track account balances, record transactions, and create budgeting plans.

The app is designed specifically for personal use for anyone looking to better manage their finances. Targetted users will be individuals, not companies. The features will be designed in such a way that even a below average user should not have trouble using it. With that in mind, features will not be sacrificed for the sake of simplicity. Users will have access to many useful features presented in an intuitive way.

Due to the sensitive nature of financial data, all parts of a user’s account must remain secure. Account data will not be accessible to anyone who is not the account owner. Any information collected or stored by the app will be compliant with both PIPPEDA and CPPA.

Current mobile financial applications are often cluttered and make navigation difficult. Oftentimes, when an app is too complicated at first glance, users will close it and not give it another thought. The app will focus on organizing features in a way that does not overload a new user. The value of this is that increased learnability will lead to a higher number of repeat users, which translates into more success in the planning and tracking of finances. This also allows users to more easily check if what they’re buying fits into their budget in real time as they are shopping.

The app will also contain a variety of quality of life features that will facilitate budgeting under different circumstances. For users who travel or order from abroad often, the app will be able to convert prices to your local currency so you know how much it is costing you in a familiar way. For users making a major purpose through a loan, the app will calculate how much extra you will be paying in interest over the duration of the loan. While these are just a couple examples, the app will have many more ways to make potential transactions more transparent and comprehensible.

The App can be considered a success if users continue to use the app. While being able to budget easily is the goal, the best way to measure this objectively is by measuring the amount of repeat users. This data will be obtained by comparing the numbers of installs to the number of active users. If active users after 30 days of install remains above 15%, the app will be considered successful.
